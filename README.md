# Demo: nsscache with Consul

This is a demo for a blog article to show nsscache using Consul to manage unix accounts.

It's not intended to be run out of this context.
The docker image doesn't follow the best practices.
Some shortcuts have been taken and there is a lack of security in the used configuration.

## Requirements

* Docker
* Docker Compose

## Usage

```bash
./run.sh
```
